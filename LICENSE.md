## License

There has been some [some discussion](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=252234) on whether PKGBUILD files are actually subject to copyright as they are effectively "recipies." Also, no license is expressly applied by AUR or any of the repositories that this repository links to as far as can be found. Therefore, it can be assumed that no copyright is implied.

In the instance that the above assumption is incorrect, all files from the conflicting source will fall under the upstream license for the conflicting source. In such a case, I will update this license file to notify users of licensing changes on a per-subdirectory basis.

The PKGBUILD files in this repository are not a part of the generated packages themselves. The software contained in the packages that the PKGBUILD files generate are each subject to their own licenses as found in the .SRCINFO and PKGBUILD files, or the respective license notifications in the source archives themselves.

Provided that PKGBUILD modifications ("patches") are actually licensable, the license that applies to modifications within this repository shall be the BSD 3-clause license as provided in the LICENSE.BSD3 file within this archive. If a licensing conflict does arise, then the modifications provided here will be re-licensed as necessary to match the license of the upstream source.
